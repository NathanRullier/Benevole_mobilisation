When working you must use this workflow
You must also use a TDD approach

1. Create tests
2. Code
3. Compilation
4. Test
5. Update Docs

try to run the application after every step and fix the problems if there are any
When working follow the plan as much as you can and check off the things you did
When working on the UI use playwright for the tests
Should should only go forth with a task when all previous tasks are complete and the project is working
